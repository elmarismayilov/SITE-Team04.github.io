                        <p>Hour of Code is the beginning stage of coding. This campaign is held every year and shows that everyone can learn the basics of coding. Team 04 held this hour of code event with 21 children in 6th grade at Kelbajar district, Secondary School No. 37 in Baku. </p>

                        <p>On November 6, Team 04 organized a successful coding workshop for sixth-grade students at School No. 37. This event was part of an outreach effort to introduce young learners to coding, using Minecraft as a practical and engaging tool. Despite facing logistical challenges, the team’s thorough preparation and adaptability ensured a positive experience for all participants.
                            The preparation began with selecting appropriate teaching materials, arranging the sequence of lessons, and printing certificates. Team 04 also coordinated with the school director, Nemat Hasanov, to finalize the logistics. The limited resources of the school presented a challenge. The team brought three laptops and a tablet but quickly realized that additional devices were needed to accommodate 21 students. The school provided two more computers, enabling the students to work in groups of 2-4, which encouraged collaboration.
                            The session started with an introduction to Ada University, highlighting its opportunities and the benefits of learning coding. This was followed by a discussion on general coding concepts, which were entirely new to the students. The Minecraft activity was then introduced, which immediately captured the children’s interest. Some were familiar with the game, and the prospect of coding within it added excitement.</p>
                        <p>Two team members served as the primary tutor and assistant, while the others managed technical issues and student needs. The tutors began by demonstrating the first three levels of the Minecraft coding activity, explaining each step in detail. The students then attempted to progress independently, with the tutors providing guidance when they encountered challenges. The children displayed remarkable intelligence and adaptability, quickly grasping the concepts and solving unfamiliar problems with minimal help.
                            The interactive nature of the activity kept the students focused and engaged. Tutors observed that while most students followed instructions closely, a few advanced rapidly through the levels, requiring individual guidance. This disparity in progress created some logistical strain, as tutors had to balance assisting advanced students with helping others. Nevertheless, the collaborative setup allowed peers to support one another, fostering teamwork.
                            Throughout the session, the school’s resources, including a projector provided by the director, were effectively utilized to facilitate the workshop. The director’s support in arranging additional computers was invaluable, as it ensured all students could participate. Certificates of completion were awarded at the end of the event, with students’ names being recorded during the session due to the lack of prior information.</p>
                        <p>The workshop was a resounding success, sparking an interest in coding among students who had no prior experience. The use of Minecraft as an educational tool proved effective in making coding accessible and enjoyable. Team 04’s careful planning, adaptability, and teamwork ensured a smooth and impactful session despite the challenges. Gratitude was extended to the school’s director and staff for their cooperation and support, which played a vital role in the event’s success.
                            This experience underscored the potential of innovative teaching methods to inspire young learners and highlighted the importance of collaboration in overcoming resource limitations.</p>
